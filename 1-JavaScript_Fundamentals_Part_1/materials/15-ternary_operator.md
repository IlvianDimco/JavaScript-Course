The conditional operator, also known as the ternary operator, is a concise way to write conditional expressions in JavaScript. It's the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (`?`), a value to be returned if the condition is true, followed by a colon (`:`), and a value to be returned if the condition is false.

The syntax of the conditional operator is as follows:

```javascript
condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse
```

- If the condition evaluates to `true`, the expression before the colon (`:`) is evaluated and returned.
- If the condition evaluates to `false`, the expression after the colon (`:`) is evaluated and returned.

The conditional operator is often used as a more concise alternative to an `if...else` statement when assigning values based on a condition.

Example:

```javascript
let age = 20;
let message = (age >= 18) ? "You are an adult" : "You are not an adult";
console.log(message); // Output: "You are an adult"
```

In this example:
- The condition `age >= 18` checks if the `age` variable is greater than or equal to 18.
- If the condition is `true`, the expression `"You are an adult"` is returned.
- If the condition is `false`, the expression `"You are not an adult"` is returned.

The conditional operator is particularly useful when the expressions being evaluated are simple and concise. However, using it excessively or in complex expressions can reduce code readability, so it's essential to strike a balance between conciseness and readability when using the conditional operator.
