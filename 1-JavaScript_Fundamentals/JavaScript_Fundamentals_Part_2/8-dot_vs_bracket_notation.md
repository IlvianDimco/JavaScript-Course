In JavaScript, both dot notation (`.`) and bracket notation (`[]`) are used to access and modify properties of objects. While they achieve the same goal, there are differences in how they are used and when they are applicable. Here's a comparison of dot notation and bracket notation:

1. **Dot Notation (`.`)**:
   - Dot notation is the most common and concise way to access properties of an object.
   - It's preferred when the property name is a valid JavaScript identifier (i.e., it doesn't contain spaces or special characters) and doesn't conflict with any reserved keywords.
   - Dot notation is easier to read and write, especially when accessing properties directly or chaining multiple property accesses.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   let person = {
       name: 'John',
       age: 30,
       city: 'New York'
   };

   console.log(person.name); // Output: 'John'
   person.age = 35; // Modify property
   ```

2. **Bracket Notation (`[]`)**:
   - Bracket notation allows you to access properties of an object using a string value (including variables) inside square brackets.
   - It's used when the property name is dynamic, contains spaces or special characters, or is stored in a variable.
   - Bracket notation is also useful when accessing properties with names that are reserved keywords or not valid JavaScript identifiers.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   let person = {
       'first name': 'John',
       age: 30,
       city: 'New York'
   };

   console.log(person['first name']); // Output: 'John'
   let propertyName = 'age';
   console.log(person[propertyName]); // Output: 30
   ```

3. **Key Differences**:
   - Dot notation is more concise and preferred for accessing properties directly or when the property name is a valid JavaScript identifier.
   - Bracket notation is more flexible and allows you to access properties dynamically or with names that are not valid identifiers.
   - Dot notation cannot be used when the property name contains spaces, starts with a number, or is a reserved keyword. Bracket notation can handle these cases.

In summary, dot notation and bracket notation are both useful for accessing and modifying properties of objects in JavaScript. Understanding when to use each notation is important for writing clean, readable, and flexible code.
