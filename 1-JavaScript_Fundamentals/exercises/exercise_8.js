// Let's improve Steven's tip calculator even more, this time using loops!
// Your tasks:
// Create an array called bills containing all 10 test bill values.
// Create empty arrays for the tips and the totals (tips and totals)
// Use the calcTip function we wrote before (included in the starter code) to calculate tips and total values (bill + tip) for every bill value in the bills array. Use a for loop to perform the 10 calculations!
// TEST DATA: 22, 295, 176, 440, 37, 105, 10, 1100, 86, and 52.
// BONUS:
// Write a function calcAverage which takes an array called arr as an argument. This function calculates the average of all numbers in the given array. This is a DIFFICULT challenge (we haven't done this before)! Here is how to solve it if you feel like it:
// First, you will need to add up all values in the array. To do the addition, start by creating a variable sum that starts at 0. Then loop over the array using a for loop. In each iteration, add the current value to the sum variable. This way, by the end of the loop, you have all values added together.
// To calculate the average, divide the sum you calculated before by the length of the array (because that's the number of elements).
// Call the function with the totals array.

const calcTip = function (bill) {
    return bill >= 50 && bill <= 300 ? bill * 0.15 : bill * 0.2;
}

let bills = [22, 295, 176, 440, 37, 105, 10, 1100, 86, 52];
let tips = [];
let totals = [];

for (let i of bills) {
    tips.push(calcTip(i))
    totals.push(i + calcTip(i))
}

console.log("bills", bills)
console.log("tips", tips)
console.log("totals", totals)

const calcAverage = (arr) => {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let x of arr) {
        sum += x
    }
    return sum / arr.length
}

console.log(calcAverage(totals))
