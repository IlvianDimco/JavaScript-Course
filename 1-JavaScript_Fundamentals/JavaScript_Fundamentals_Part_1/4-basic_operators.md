In JavaScript, operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. Here are some of the basic operators in JavaScript:

1. **Arithmetic Operators**:
   - `+` : Addition
   - `-` : Subtraction
   - `*` : Multiplication
   - `/` : Division
   - `%` : Modulus (Remainder after division)
   - `**` : Exponentiation (ES6)

2. **Assignment Operators**:
   - `=` : Assigns a value to a variable
   - `+=` : Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand
   - `-=` : Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand
   - `*=` : Multiplies the right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand
   - `/=` : Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand
   - `%=` : Computes the modulus of the two operands and assigns the result to the left operand

3. **Comparison Operators**:
   - `==` : Equal to
   - `===` : Strict equal to (checks both value and type)
   - `!=` : Not equal to
   - `!==` : Strict not equal to (checks both value and type)
   - `>` : Greater than
   - `<` : Less than
   - `>=` : Greater than or equal to
   - `<=` : Less than or equal to

4. **Logical Operators**:
   - `&&` : Logical AND
   - `||` : Logical OR
   - `!` : Logical NOT

5. **Unary Operators**:
   - `++` : Increment (adds 1)
   - `--` : Decrement (subtracts 1)

6. **Ternary Operator**:
   - `condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse` : Also known as the conditional operator. It evaluates a condition and returns one of two values depending on whether the condition is true or false.

7. **Bitwise Operators**:
   - `&` : Bitwise AND
   - `|` : Bitwise OR
   - `^` : Bitwise XOR (exclusive OR)
   - `~` : Bitwise NOT (one's complement)
   - `<<` : Left shift
   - `>>` : Right shift
   - `>>>` : Zero-fill right shift

These are some of the basic operators in JavaScript. They are used extensively in writing scripts and applications for various purposes, such as arithmetic calculations, logical operations, and data manipulation.
