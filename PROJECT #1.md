**Guess My Number Project README**

Welcome to the Guess My Number project! In this project, you'll be creating a simple game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where the user needs to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range, typically between 1 and 1000, within a limited number of tries, such as 10 attempts.

**Project Overview:**

The game involves the following components:

1. **HTML**: This will define the structure of your webpage. You'll need input fields for the user to enter their guesses, buttons for submitting guesses and starting/restarting the game, and areas to display feedback such as whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.

2. **CSS**: This will handle the styling of your HTML elements to make your game visually appealing and user-friendly.

3. **JavaScript**: This is the core of the game logic. You'll use JavaScript to generate a random number for the user to guess, handle user input, provide feedback on the user's guesses, keep track of the number of attempts remaining, and manage the game state (e.g., whether the game is in progress, won, or lost).

**Roadmap:**

1. **Set Up Your Project Environment:**
   - Create a new directory for your project.
   - Set up your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files within this directory.

2. **HTML Structure:**
   - Create the basic structure of your HTML file.
   - Define input fields for the user's guesses, buttons for submitting guesses and restarting the game, and areas for displaying feedback.

3. **CSS Styling:**
   - Style your HTML elements using CSS to make your game visually appealing.
   - Consider using colors, fonts, and layout techniques to enhance the user experience.

4. **JavaScript Logic:**
   - Generate a random number between 1 and 1000 for the user to guess.
   - Set up event listeners to handle user input (e.g., when the user submits a guess).
   - Compare the user's guess to the randomly generated number and provide feedback (e.g., "Too high," "Too low," "Correct!").
   - Keep track of the number of attempts remaining and update the UI accordingly.
   - Handle edge cases, such as invalid input or the user running out of attempts.
   - Implement functionality to restart the game once it's over.

5. **Testing and Debugging:**
   - Test your game thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected.
   - Debug any issues that arise during testing.

6. **Optimization and Refinement:**
   - Refactor your code to make it more efficient and maintainable.
   - Consider adding additional features or improving existing ones to enhance the gameplay experience.

7. **Documentation:**
   - Document your code using comments to explain its purpose and functionality.

**Required Knowledge:**

To complete this project, you'll need a basic understanding of the following technologies:

- HTML: Familiarity with HTML tags and attributes for creating the structure of web pages.
- CSS: Knowledge of CSS selectors, properties, and values for styling HTML elements.
- JavaScript: Understanding of JavaScript syntax, variables, functions, conditionals, loops, and event handling.
- DOM Manipulation: Ability to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to update the content and style of HTML elements dynamically.
- Random Number Generation: Knowledge of generating random numbers using JavaScript's Math.random() function.
- Basic Game Logic: Understanding of game logic concepts such as generating random numbers, comparing values, and managing game state.
