Arrow functions are a concise way to write function expressions in JavaScript. They were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and provide a shorter syntax compared to traditional function expressions. Arrow functions are especially useful for writing anonymous functions or short, single-expression functions.

Here's the basic syntax of arrow functions:

```javascript
(parameters) => { statements }
```

Or for single-parameter functions with no curly braces around the function body (implicit return):

```javascript
parameter => expression
```

And here's an example of an arrow function:

```javascript
let add = (a, b) => {
    return a + b;
};
```

In this example:
- `add` is the name of the function.
- `(a, b)` are the parameters passed to the function.
- `=>` is the arrow syntax indicating that this is an arrow function.
- `{ return a + b; }` is the function body, containing the statements executed when the function is called.

If the function body consists of only one statement, you can omit the curly braces `{}` and the `return` keyword, and the expression will be implicitly returned. This is particularly useful for short, concise functions.

```javascript
let multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
```

Arrow functions have some key characteristics:

1. **Lexical `this` binding**:
   Arrow functions do not have their own `this` context; instead, they inherit `this` from the surrounding lexical context. This behavior can be useful when working with object methods or callbacks where you want to preserve the value of `this`.

2. **No `arguments` object**:
   Arrow functions do not have their own `arguments` object like traditional functions. Instead, they inherit `arguments` from the enclosing scope.

3. **Cannot be used as constructors**:
   Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors with the `new` keyword. They lack the `prototype` property and constructor behavior.

Arrow functions are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript and are widely used in ES6 and later codebases for their concise syntax and lexical scoping behavior. However, it's essential to be aware of their limitations, particularly regarding `this` binding and the absence of an `arguments` object.
