In JavaScript, strings are sequences of characters, such as letters, digits, symbols, and spaces, enclosed within single (''), double ("") quotes, or backticks (```). Strings can be manipulated and concatenated to form new strings. 

Template literals, introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), are a new way to define strings in JavaScript. They allow for easier string interpolation and multiline strings compared to traditional strings defined with single or double quotes.

Here's an explanation of strings and template literals in JavaScript:

1. **Strings**:
   - Strings can be created using single quotes (`''`), double quotes (`""`), or backticks (`` ` ``).
   - Escape sequences like `\n` for newline, `\t` for tab, etc., can be used within strings.
   - Strings are immutable, meaning once they are created, their values cannot be changed. However, new strings can be created based on existing ones through manipulation methods.
   
   Example:
   ```javascript
   let singleQuotes = 'Hello, world!';
   let doubleQuotes = "Hello, world!";
   let backticks = `Hello, world!`;

   let stringWithEscape = 'Hello\nworld'; // Newline
   ```

2. **Template Literals**:
   - Template literals are enclosed within backticks (`` ` ``) instead of single or double quotes.
   - They support string interpolation, allowing variables and expressions to be embedded directly within the string using `${}`.
   - Template literals can span multiple lines without needing escape characters, making multiline strings easier to create.
   
   Example:
   ```javascript
   let name = 'Alice';
   let age = 30;
   let greeting = `Hello, my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;

   let multiLine = `This is a 
   multiline 
   string.`;
   ```

Template literals offer a more readable and convenient way to work with strings, especially when dealing with dynamic content or multiline strings. They're widely used in modern JavaScript development for their simplicity and flexibility.
