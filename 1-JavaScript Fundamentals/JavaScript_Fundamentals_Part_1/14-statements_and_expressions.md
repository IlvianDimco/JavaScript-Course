In JavaScript, statements and expressions are fundamental building blocks used to create programs. While they might seem similar, they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics.

1. **Statements**:
   - A statement is a complete unit of code that performs a specific action. It usually ends with a semicolon (`;`).
   - Statements can include variable declarations, assignments, function declarations, control structures (like `if`, `for`, `while`, `switch`), and function calls.
   - Statements are executed sequentially, one after another, from top to bottom.
   
   Example of statements:
   ```javascript
   let x = 10; // Variable declaration and assignment statement
   console.log("Hello, world!"); // Function call statement
   if (x > 5) { // Control structure statement
       console.log("x is greater than 5.");
   }
   ```

2. **Expressions**:
   - An expression is a piece of code that produces a value. It can be a single value, a variable, or a combination of values and operators.
   - Expressions can be used anywhere a value is expected, such as in variable assignments, function arguments, and return statements.
   - JavaScript expressions can be simple (like `5` or `"hello"`) or complex (like `(x + y) * 2`).
   
   Example of expressions:
   ```javascript
   let x = 5; // Assignment expression
   let y = 10; // Assignment expression
   let sum = x + y; // Arithmetic expression
   let greeting = "Hello, " + "world!"; // String concatenation expression
   let isGreater = x > y; // Comparison expression
   ```

3. **Differences**:
   - The main difference between statements and expressions is that statements perform actions, while expressions produce values.
   - Expressions can be embedded within statements. For example, in the assignment statement `let sum = x + y;`, the expression `x + y` calculates a value that is then assigned to the variable `sum`.
   - Not all statements contain expressions. For example, an empty statement (`;`) or a `break` statement is a statement without an expression.

In summary, statements are the building blocks of JavaScript programs that perform actions, while expressions produce values. Understanding the distinction between statements and expressions is crucial for writing clear and effective JavaScript code.
