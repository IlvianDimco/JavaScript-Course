In JavaScript, type conversion and coercion are two mechanisms used to convert values from one data type to another. While both involve changing the type of a value, they operate differently and serve different purposes.

1. **Type Conversion**:
   Type conversion refers to the explicit conversion of a value from one data type to another. This can be done using built-in JavaScript functions or methods.

   Example of type conversion:
   ```javascript
   let num = 10;
   let str = String(num); // Explicitly convert number to string
   ```

   Common type conversion functions include:
   - `String()`: Converts a value to a string.
   - `Number()`: Converts a value to a number.
   - `Boolean()`: Converts a value to a boolean.

2. **Type Coercion**:
   Type coercion, also known as implicit type conversion, occurs when JavaScript automatically converts a value from one data type to another during operations.

   Example of type coercion:
   ```javascript
   let x = 10;
   let y = "20";
   let result = x + y; // JavaScript coerces x to a string and performs string concatenation
   ```

   In this example, `x` is coerced into a string, and then string concatenation is performed with the string `"20"`, resulting in `"1020"`.

   Type coercion occurs in various situations, such as arithmetic operations involving different data types, comparison operators, and logical operators.

   Some examples of type coercion:
   ```javascript
   console.log(5 + "5"); // "55" (number is coerced to string)
   console.log("5" - 1); // 4 (string is coerced to number)
   console.log("10" == 10); // true (string is coerced to number for comparison)
   ```

   It's important to be aware of type coercion in JavaScript, as it can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior. To ensure clarity and avoid potential issues, you may opt for explicit type conversion instead of relying on implicit coercion.

Understanding type conversion and coercion is essential for writing JavaScript code that behaves as expected and for handling data types effectively.
