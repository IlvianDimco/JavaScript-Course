In JavaScript, every value has an associated boolean value, which is often referred to as its truthy or falsy value. When a non-boolean value is used in a boolean context, it's implicitly converted to its corresponding boolean value. This conversion is based on whether the value is considered "truthy" or "falsy".

1. **Truthy Values**:
   Values that are considered truthy evaluate to `true` when converted to a boolean. These values are not limited to the boolean `true`, but include any value that isn't falsy. Some common truthy values include:
   - Non-empty strings (`"hello"`)
   - Non-zero numbers (e.g., `1`, `-1`, `0.1`)
   - Objects (including arrays and functions)
   - The special value `Infinity`

   Example:
   ```javascript
   if ("hello") {
       console.log("This is truthy.");
   }
   // Output: This is truthy.
   ```

2. **Falsy Values**:
   Values that are considered falsy evaluate to `false` when converted to a boolean. These values include:
   - An empty string `""`
   - The number `0` (zero)
   - `NaN` (Not-a-Number)
   - `null`
   - `undefined`
   - The boolean `false`

   Example:
   ```javascript
   if (0) {
       console.log("This is falsy.");
   }
   // No output because 0 is falsy.
   ```

   Note: An empty array (`[]`) and an empty object (`{}`) are considered truthy because they are objects, even though they are "empty".

Truthy and falsy values are important concepts in JavaScript, especially when using conditional statements (like `if` statements) or when evaluating expressions in boolean contexts. Understanding these values helps in writing more concise and expressive code.
